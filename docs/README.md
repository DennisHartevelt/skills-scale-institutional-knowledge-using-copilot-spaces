# OctoAcme Project Management Docs — README

## Overview

OctoAcme's project management approach prioritizes customer value through iterative delivery, clear ownership, and data-informed decisions. Our projects follow a structured lifecycle from initiation through retrospective, with each phase supported by specific artifacts and communication practices. This ensures transparency, minimizes risk, and enables teams to deliver reliably while maintaining psychological safety and continuous learning.

At the core of our process are three key roles: the Project Manager coordinates delivery timelines, risks, and cross-functional communication; the Product Manager defines customer outcomes and prioritizes the backlog; and Developers implement features with quality and testability in mind. Supporting these roles are QA/Testing specialists who validate acceptance criteria and stakeholders who provide input and approvals. Each project generates essential artifacts including a Project Charter, roadmap, sprint backlogs, risk register, and retrospective notes that guide decision-making and knowledge capture.

Communication follows predictable cadences to maintain alignment without creating overhead. Weekly syncs between Project and Product Managers ensure strategic alignment, while twice-weekly standups keep delivery teams coordinated on tactical execution. Monthly stakeholder updates provide visibility into progress and upcoming milestones, with ad-hoc escalations addressing urgent blockers. This rhythm ensures the right information reaches the right people at the right time.

Quality assurance is embedded throughout the delivery lifecycle, not just at the end. Teams define clear acceptance criteria and a Definition of Done during planning, continuously validate features against these standards during execution, and conduct thorough testing before release. Post-deployment, teams hold blameless retrospectives to capture learnings and identify process improvements, creating a culture of continuous improvement that scales institutional knowledge across the organization.

## How to Use These Docs

This README serves as the primary entry point for understanding OctoAcme's project management processes. New team members should start here to get oriented, then explore individual process documents as needed for their role and project phase.

All process documentation lives in the `docs/` folder and can be referenced directly or linked from project-specific materials. When working on a project, keep your Project Charter and related artifacts in your project repository for easy access.

For teams using GitHub Copilot Spaces, you can add relevant process documents to the `.copilot/` directory in your project repository to provide Copilot with context about OctoAcme's workflows, making it easier to generate role-appropriate guidance, templates, and suggestions aligned with our established practices.
