# OctoAcme — Project Planning

## Purpose
Turn an approved initiative into an actionable plan and backlog for delivery.

## Objectives
- Break work into shippable increments
- Identify dependencies and risks
- Align timelines, releases, and responsibilities

## Activities
1. Kickoff meeting with stakeholders and delivery team
2. Create prioritized backlog with acceptance criteria
3. Estimate scope (T-shirt sizing or story points)
4. Define Definition of Done (DoD)
5. Identify dependencies and integration points
6. Create release plan and milestone map

## Backlog Item Template
- Title:
- Description:
- Acceptance criteria:
- Priority:
- Estimate:
- Owner:
- Related docs/links:

## Sprint / Iteration Planning
- Timebox planning to agreed sprint length
- Pull items that meet DoD and have clear acceptance criteria
- Ensure team capacity is respected

## Risk & Dependency Management
- Capture in Risk Register:
  - ID, Description, Impact, Probability, Owner, Mitigation
- Mark cross-team dependencies in the project board and escalate during weekly syncs

## Role Participation in Planning

The planning phase involves collaboration across multiple roles defined in our [Roles and Personas](octoacme-roles-and-personas.md) documentation:

### During Planning Phase
- **Project Manager**: Leads planning activities, creates project timeline, manages dependencies and risks
- **Product Manager**: Defines and prioritizes backlog, clarifies acceptance criteria
- **Developers**: Provide estimates, identify technical risks and dependencies
- **Quality Assurance Lead**: Reviews acceptance criteria, estimates testing effort, creates initial test plan (see [QA Checklist](templates/qa-checklist.md))
- **Stakeholder Liaison**: Ensures stakeholder requirements are captured and expectations are aligned
- **Communication Coordinator**: Schedules planning meetings, captures decisions and action items

### During Execution & QA
- **Developers**: Implement features according to plan
- **Quality Assurance Lead**: Executes test plan, triages defects with Development Lead
- **Communication Coordinator**: Provides status updates to stakeholders
- **Project Manager**: Tracks progress, manages risks and issues

### During Release
- **Release Manager**: Coordinates deployment, validates release readiness (see [Release Checklist](templates/release-checklist.md))
- **Quality Assurance Lead**: Provides final testing sign-off
- **Product Operations (ProdOps)**: Receives handoff for post-release monitoring
- **Communication Coordinator**: Communicates release schedule and results to stakeholders

See the [RACI Matrix](octoacme-roles-and-personas.md#raci-matrix-for-common-project-activities) in the Roles and Personas doc for detailed accountability across all project activities.
