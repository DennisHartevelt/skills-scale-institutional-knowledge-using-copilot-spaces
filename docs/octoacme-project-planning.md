# Project Planning

## Roles & Participation during Planning and Delivery

The project planning process should explicitly call out where the roles described in `docs/octoacme-roles-and-personas.md` participate across the lifecycle:

- Planning
  - Project Manager (PM) is accountable for planning cadence and tracking; Product Owner (PO) is responsible for backlog prioritization; Stakeholder Liaison gathers stakeholder constraints and input. The Communication Coordinator ensures stakeholder communication plans are included in the project schedule.
  - Link: ../docs/octoacme-roles-and-personas.md

- Execution (Sprints / Iterations)
  - Dev Lead coordinates technical delivery; QA Lead participates in sprint planning for test estimation and acceptance criteria; Stakeholder Liaison ensures stakeholder feedback is captured for upcoming work.
  - QA leads should be invited early to planning sessions to align on acceptance criteria and test coverage.

- QA & Testing
  - QA Lead is responsible for test plans and execution; ProdOps and Dev Lead are consulted for environment and deployment readiness. Use the QA checklist: ../docs/templates/qa-checklist.md

- Release & Handover
  - Release Manager coordinates the release window, rollback plan, and readiness checks. ProdOps performs post-release validation and incident monitoring. Use the release checklist: ../docs/templates/release-checklist.md
  - The Communication Coordinator will publish release communications and stakeholder summaries.

These role interactions reduce ambiguity during hand-offs and help ensure accountability from planning through production. TODO: confirm scheduling templates and channels for handoffs (e.g., Slack channels or runbook links).
